Attempt to learn operations of Git

My first time to learn Git and GitHub.
Hope the process will be smooth!

//The new context//
Oh my goosh!
It seems that I've made a mistake at the very beginging!
I've edited the main branch but not the edit-branch!
Whatever, that was not a serious one, but also a good chance for me to get familiar with this website.

Hope such mistake won't take place again!
